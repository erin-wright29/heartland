          <p>
            <strong>Heartland</strong> is a digital collection of my personal antique and vintage treasures. Inspired by the charm of old GeoCities sites and kitschy web aesthetics, this project invites you to explore my collection decade by decade.
            This collection spans years of collecting - sourced from antique malls, thrift stores, markets and my grandparents' house.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name <strong>'Heartland'</strong> is a nod to the old GeoCities neighborhood, where people once built websites to share snapshots of family life, home, and personal stories. Here, <strong>Heartland</strong> functions as a way for me to share my family and personal stories through antiques.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s still a work in progress - as my collection is pretty extensive - so new items will be added over time. This site was created as part of a Graphic Design course at OCADU and is also my first attempt at coding!

          <p>
            My name is Erin and I'm the creator of <strong>Heartland!</strong> I'm a Graphic Design student at OCADU interested in combining my love of old things with design. I've found great joy in creating work that bridges the gap between contemporary design and historical art practices and design, while also celebrating the material arts and their history of connecting women to creativity and identity across generations. 
            Through these techniques, I pay homage to the ingenuity of women in history, reviving the beauty and purpose they found in their craft. My aim is to collect the objects people once found joy in - pieces of the past that helped create memories and have since faded from focus. Through them, I hope to preserve their quiet magic.
