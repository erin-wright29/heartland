                Heartland is a digital collection of my personal antique and vintage treasures. Inspired by the charm of old GeoCities sites and kitschy web aesthetics, this project invites you to explore my collection decade by decade. 
                The name 'Heartland' is a nod to the old GeoCities neighborhoods, where people once built websites to share snapshots of family life, home, and personal stories. Here 'Heartland' functions as a way for me to share my family and personal stories through antiques. It’s still a work in progress - as my collection is pretty extensive - so new items will be added over time.

            </p>This site was created as part of a Graphic Design course at OCADU and my first attempt at coding!
